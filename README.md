**THIS IS THE BETA VERSION** Please do not complain about it being unstable, it is a beta. This is to test a new UI and improved UI on, as well as improved code and stability in the future.

## Installation
Go to the `master` branch [here](https://github.com/verlox/Lithium-Nuker-2/tree/master)

## Warning
There are known compatibility issues with **Windows Terminal**. Please use native **Command Prompt**. I have not found any fixes, as it has to do with how console C# interacts with Windows Terminal.

## "Lithium is malware/logger"!
Check the code. Lithium has never had any loggers or malware. I have no reason to put it in and will never include any type of malware in my projects. Please gather proof before accusing people.
